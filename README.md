# Prediction-of-House-prices-using-Linear-Regression-and-Random-Forests

## Source

This project is a task in the GUCMUN IEEE machine learning committee

## TASK
### Our goal for this task is to use the house prices training dataset to create a model and use that model to predict prices for the house prices test dataset

* Apply end-to-end machine learning steps on a house prices dataset
* Use a hands-on approach to learning scikit-learn and its uses in machine learning*

## Tool
Jupyter Notebooks
